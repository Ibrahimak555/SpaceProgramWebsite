<h1 align="middle">Black Hole</h1>
<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape from it.</p>
<p>A black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.</p>
<p>Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses, may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.</p>
<p>The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed."</p>
