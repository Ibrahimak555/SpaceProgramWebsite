<p>Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System.</p>
<p>Millions of asteroids exist, many are shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within the young Sun's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets.</p>
<p>Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from comets and meteoroids.</p>
<p>The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, generally in relatively low-eccentricity orbits. This belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 km in diameter, and millions of smaller ones. These asteroids may be remnants of the protoplanetary disk, and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the Solar System was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by Jupiter.</p>
