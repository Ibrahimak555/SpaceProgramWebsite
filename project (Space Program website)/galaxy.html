<h1 align="middle">Galaxy</h1>
<p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.</p>
<p>Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.</p>
<p>In 2021, data from NASA's New Horizons space probe was used to revise the previous estimate of 2 trillion galaxies down to roughly 200 billion galaxies. This followed a 2016 estimate that there were two trillion or more galaxies in the observable universe, overall, as many as an estimated stars</p>
<p>The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) having an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. The majority of galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters, and superclusters.<br> At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids.</p>
